        <b>1. How do I benefit from being a group leader (host)?
        </b>
        <br>
        Being a host helps you to earn commissions on your group’s members’ purchases. <br>
        The commission ranges from 5% to 20% per product. <br>
        The specific commision percentage per product will only be revealed after hosts’ first hosting. 
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <b>2. How many hostings do I need to do?</b><br>
        Hosts have to do a minimum of 1 hosting per week. <br>
        If there is no hosting for consecutively 2 weeks, the host account will be suspended.
        <br>
        <br>

        
        <b>3. Do I need to have my own fridge to store the items?</b><br>
        Some of the products we sell are halal products.<br>
        It is not necessary as the frozen items delivered to your house are meant to last till the members come and collect on the same day of delivery. <br>
        Thus, fridge storage may not be needed unless the members collect the following day.        
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>4. Is there any minimum order per delivery for hosts?</b><br>
        During the first month, minimum order per delivery for host is $100<br>
        Starting from the second month, minimum order per delivery for host is $200<br>
        We are expecting for new host, the first month total sales should be $400 <br>
        The second month total sales should be $800 <br>
        From the third month onwards, total sales should be $2000
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <b>5. Are the items halal?</b><br>
        Our company sells products that are non-halal. <br>
        However, there are also a selection of halal products available.
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>6. 	Is there an cut-off time for orders? </b><br>
        Cut-off timing is at 11am one day before delivery date (payment must be done by specified timing).<br>
        ! Saybons :<br>
        Cut-off time: 3 working days in advanced at 11am
        <br>
        <br>

        <b>7. 	Are the deliveries or collection flexible?</b><br>
        Yes they are. Deliveries can be arranged on any day of the week except Monday. <br>
        The delivery time will be between 11am to 8pm. 
        <br>
        <br>

        
        <b>8. How to refund?</b><br>
        Method 1: <br>
        Customer submits refund request in Customer page => Group Leader approves in Group Leader page => WeBuy admin processes<br>
        Method 2:<br>
        Group Leader submits in Group Leader page => WeBuy admin processes <br>
        Refund/return claims needs to submit within 24 hours of collection. Webuy will then process the refund request and refund will be transferred to customer’s assets. If they require time longer than 24 hours, check with webuy before submitting the refund request form
        <br>
        <br>
        
        <b>9. How to change the delivery date and delivery method?</b><br>
        When orders under status “To Ship”, Group Leader can change the Delivery method ( Home Delivery or Pickup)<br>
        and Delivery Date for the customers. When orders under status “To Ship ( Packing)”, mean that orders already pass the cut-off time, so can not change Delivery Method and Delivery Date anymore
